# T20-Cricket-Cheat-Codes-Unleashed

**Overview**
This project aims to predict expected runs in T20 cricket based on detailed ball-by-ball data analysis. By evaluating performance metrics, we assess the effectiveness of various batters and identify the most prolific players in T20 cricket.

**Expected Runs Calculation**
Expected Runs are determined by calculating the simple average of all T20 matches played since January 1, 2015. The expected runs for each ball faced by a batter are influenced by three key factors:

_Innings Run Rate (RR) Before the Ball
Number of Wickets Down Before the Ball
Innings Balls Remaining Before the Ball Bowled_
The formula captures the dynamics of the game and provides a benchmark against which actual performance can be compared.

**Runs Above Average Replacement (RAAR)**
Runs Above Average Replacement (RAAR) is calculated by comparing the expected runs with the actual runs scored by a batter. This metric helps to quantify a batter's contribution above the average expectation set by the aforementioned factors.

Sample Data
The table below summarizes the performance of select prolific T20 batters:

Batter	Total Batruns	Total Expected Runs	Total RAAR
AB de Villiers	5829	4827.31	1001.69
Aaron Finch	7677	7320.56	356.44
Andre Russell	6951	5709.13	1241.87
Chris Gayle	7721	6651.72	1069.28
Virat Kohli	8588	8529.38	58.62
**Analysis Findings**
From the ball-by-ball data analysis, we've concluded that:

_Batters who take more risks by playing false shots tend to have higher rewards, making them more prolific in T20 formats._
The ability to convert potential risks into runs distinguishes the top players from the rest.
**T20 Cheat Sheets**
We have also compiled cheat sheets that summarize key insights into T20 batting strategies, focusing on metrics such as strike rates, false shots, and how they correlate with overall performance. This data will be invaluable for coaches, analysts, and fans looking to understand the nuances of T20 cricket.

**Conclusion**
This project provides an analytical framework to assess and predict T20 batting performances using advanced statistical methods. By understanding the relationship between expected runs and actual performance, we can gain deeper insights into what makes a batter successful in the dynamic world of T20 cricket.

Future Work
In future iterations of this project, we plan to expand the dataset and incorporate additional variables such as pitch conditions, opponent strength, and match context to refine our predictions further.
